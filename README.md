# HealthUp! 
A companion for your fitness journey.

Our goal through HealthUp! is to simplify the experience of people trying to improve their physical health. Both of us find that being fit is a great contributor to living a long happy life. Through the app, we want to support users’ efforts in being more aware of what they are eating with a barcode scanner to list out specific nutrients. We may incorporate this feature into a macronutrient tracker. Another aspect of healthy living is exercising, and our workout diary can assist our users by keeping track of their sets and reps for each exercise. Users will also be able to create a workout from a list of recommended exercises.

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully started using HealthUp!. :partying_face:
Enjoy your time with our app.
